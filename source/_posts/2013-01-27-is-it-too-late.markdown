I don't get the fascination of some to want to short the market just because it's poking into some new high territory. Everything I follow about the US equity market is still bullish. Nonetheless, it reminds me of a story...

It's July 16th 1990, and I"m sitting in a fabric covered box with a headset chained to my head. "(Name of Mutual Fund company), this is Dan Robbins on a recorded line. How may I help you?" as I said about 70 or 80 times a day. The caller didn't even return the greeting, "Is it too late to buy the International fund?" At this moment, this fund was the best performer of the fund family over the past year or so and I knew what he meant, but gave him a party line answer, "Oh, it's an open end mutual fund. You can always buy or sell shares in the fund!" "No, no, is it going to keep going up?" said the caller. Of course I had to feed back the usual, "Well I can't give you advice, past performance is not an indicator of future returns" or something like that. The caller ended up buying shares, chasing the hot investment of the moment. Little did he know that was the peak of the market at the time as Iraq would invade Kuwait just weeks later. No doubt, I bet this guy ended up selling the position just before the market took off in early January 2011. 

I figured I spoke to about 20,000 callers in my two years on the phone, and it was a great experience. Through taking the series 7, reading the Wall Street Journal everyday, and talking to people all over the country each day, I learned much about both personal finance as well as investor psychology. Back then it always seemed like investors were chasing performance, well they still do, don't they?

I don't remember many more calls in particular, the memory of them bleed into each other. But it amazed me that people all over the country, with a heck of a lot more money than I had, would call a toll-free number and ask a young twenty something recent college graduate about investments. I was supposed to tell them how to save for retirement or college, or a mortgage? Really? Like I said, I learned a lot about investor psychology, and it reminds me of the poster in Mulder's X-Files office, "I want to Believe"

So getting back to today's market. Why does a recent high bring out the bears?
