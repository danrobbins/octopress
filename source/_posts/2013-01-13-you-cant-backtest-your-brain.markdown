It's super easy to look at a chart and pick out the buy and sell points. The question in trading/investing is what you use to make these decisions and how to manage the position while active. The chart is nothing more than historical facts. The rest is what we, as humans, wish to apply on top of it. Those things we apply on top may be

* derivatives of the historical prices (i.e. moving averages, MACD, RSI, stochastics, etc.) or 
* our interpretations of all the lines and squiggles

Take a look at all the different indicators (studies) provided by [thinkorswim](http://team.thinkorswim.com/manual/dark/studies/studies%20library/index.html). I counted 273 studies, and it grows with each release. On top of that, you can write your own studies using their thinkscript language, or obtain custom studies through sites like [thinkscripter](http://www.thinkscripter.com). Wow - so much choice! Each different indicator written by somebody who codified a theory into lines or arrows - and made the workings available (usually) to the public. Since I've gotten more involved in the markets over the past 6 years, I've seen many, many different types of charts posted by others or those I've experimented on my own. Tick charts, range charts, Charts with 10 or more indicators. Check out the swami and thermo charts available on thinkorswim [here](http://mediaserver.thinkorswim.com/notices/Release_032412.html) Ouch - how does one make decisions from that?

I'm not here to bash convoluted charts or the use of indicators. I use indicators, but I can explain each one I use in under a minute. But if you're looking for a crutch, or to remove yourself from decision making (i.e. "stupid HFT traders cost me money") then you're not using them as intended. I've read lots and lots of market related books, financial blogs, followed traders on twitter and the most basic repeatable lesson I've learned is this:

* Have a method to determine the trend
* Trade within that trend

Yes, easy to write, and difficult to carry out for many, myself included too sometimes. Why? Because we let our brains mess with that basic formula of trading within the trend. We let news, opinion, tips, contrary opinion, etc. cloud our judgement. As I said in the first sentence, it's super easy to look at a chart and pick out the buy and sell points. You can write code to test specific buy and sell signals (backtesting) but *you can't backtest your brain.* You can't write code to test all the types of reactions and emotional responses when you have money on the line. 

In the next few posts I'm going to write how I've constructed my charts and what I've done to be scientific about how I view the market and take trades in the pursuit of trading within a trend.
