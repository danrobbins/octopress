Quick update until the weekend. It's still all bullish, though any decent oscillator type thingy will look over-valued right now. Over-valued isn't a reason to sell, just not a place to increase aggressiveness. I like using [stockcharts'](http://www.stockcharts.com) bullish percent indicators - I'm not into point and figure charts myself, but the aggregate charts they produce are nice and clean for intermediate trends. [This is a a search at stockcharts.com ](http://stockcharts.com/symsearch/index.html?%24bp) that lists, mainly at the top, the bullish percent indexes they offer. Not all useful, but check them out.

Here's the chart I reviewed tonight, if you're not a member of the site, you won't be able to re-create the chart for yourself exactly.
