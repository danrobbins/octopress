Hello and welcome to blendertrend.com. I'm Dan.

I just got the site up and running and there's more to come, however keep in mind this site is a hobby and while I (and maybe some friends)  will discuss a variety of topics such as the markets, technology and so forth, please consider this information just for educational purposes. Any charts and writings posted represent my thoughts on the market and act somewhat as a public journal of my interpretations of the market. 

That said, I welcome any feedback you have, either in the comments on each post, or feel free to mention me on twitter at [@blenderking](https://twitter.com/blenderking).

This site is powered by Octopress and generated via Amazon EC2. For more about how I created this site, see my post on my [Octopress setup](http://www.blendertrend.com/2013/01/03/octopress/)

I also run [blenderking.com](http://www.blenderking.com). Stop by there for some of my tasty margarita recipes!
